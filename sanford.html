	<p> I am originally from Sanford, Maine. 3 hour's south of the University of Maine and only 20 minutes from the New Hampshire border.</p> 

	<p> I was born in Sanford at Goodall Hospital on July 19th 1992.</p>

	<p> I went through the Sanford educational system eventually graduating from Sanford High School in 2010. Though when I went to high school we still had the old crappy school built in the 1960's. Our school colors where red and white but all the lockers where orange. The tiles on the floor where about every color you could image but with no pattern at all.</p>
