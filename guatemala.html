	<p>One very important aspect of my time at UMaine has been the experience I gained doing international volunteer work. I first came to UMaine when spring break was still 2 weeks long! During 3 spring breaks (my freshmen,sophmore, and junior years) I volunteered in 3 seperate countries.</p>

	<p>My first trip was to Guatemala, a relatively unknown country that is comparably sized to Tennessee. It is a country that was devastated by a civil war in the 1980's and show a genocide committed against a lot of the indignous population. When I visited in 2011, it was still a country very much in the rebuilding stage almost 20 years removed from the war.I stayed with a local family, which proved to be difficult because my high school spanish was nonexistant and they spoke no english, but the experience living with somebody that wasn't like much was amazing.</p><div style="width:image width px; font-size:65%; text-align:center;"><img src="guatemala1.jpg" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>Xela skyline</div> 
	
	<p>My second trip was to Costa Rica, a relative success story when it comes to central america. A very basis history of the region. Every country in central america has been ravaged by civil war at one time or another in the last 100 years. Some countries continue today and others are rebuilding today. Costa Rica only experience a small civil war. I know that sounds weird, "small", but a couple month civil war in 1940's was the last major violence experienced in the country. In fact, after the civil war, the country abolished its military and even today has no standing military force. I worked on a farm, I don't even know if the town had a name, and we did farm work. Now this wasn't American style farming. This was very small and mainly everything was on hills. Costa Rica is very hilly and farmers have adapted by farming almost any terrain they can. The farm we were on mainly grew pineapples, which I didn't know grew out of the ground.</p><div style="width:image width px; font-size:65%; text-align:center;"><img src="pineapple.jpg" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>WHO KNEW THEY GREW THIS WAY!</div>

	<p>My third and last trip was to Nicaragua. Sadly, Nicaragua was an experience that was interesting to say the least. Like mentioned before, many central american countries experienced civil war and Nicaragua was absolutely no different. The United States played a covert role in the war, we supported the sandista rebels by simplying them with weapons against the government. This is more commonly known as the Iran-Contra Scandal. We sold weapons to Iran, which violated sanctions, and then used that money to fund the rebels in Nicaragua. There is a lot of hostility towards American's in Nicaragua. The rebels lost the war and people have not forgotton the affect of the role the United States played. We stayed at a facility where there was a security guard, something far different from staying in locals homes, we were confronted almost daily by a local. Generally, I think Nicaragua is on the brink of unrest almost everyday and seeing the role of the government on the people I can see why. We struggled immensely in country because the organization we were "working" through only ever experienced America's visiting and then writing checks. We obviously were there to work and help but it took atleast a few days before work was found. Actually the first couple of days was spent touring the jail and hospital because I believe they expected us to give them money. Though I think out time could have been better spent it was an experience I won't forget.</p><div style="width:image width px; font-size:65%; text-align:center;"><img src="nicaragua.jpg" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>Jinotenga</div>
